# 📈 Backtest Platform

## 🧠 Overview
The **Backtest Platform** is a Python-based framework designed for backtesting and analyzing trading strategies on historical financial data.  
It allows traders and data scientists to simulate different strategies, evaluate performance metrics, and optimize parameters before deploying them in live trading environments.

This project provides a modular and extensible foundation for developing and testing algorithmic trading ideas efficiently.
